📢 Greetings! You may have heard about the Puspal Roy incident at HDFC Bank , where a manager verbally abused staff members for not meeting company goals.

🌟 Now, amidst the discussions and social media hashtags, I believe it's crucial to move beyond mere words. This project aims to present a solution to industry leaders like Microsoft and Cisco.

💡 Why Cisco, you may ask? Well, during a recent livestream event, Cisco announced its plans to introduce a meeting summarizer using advanced Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by this, I've developed an idea that could seamlessly integrate with their initiatives.

🤔 So, what's my idea all about? Let's dive right in.

📑 Microsoft Teams' features include subtitles, downloads, and storage. Leveraging meeting transcriptions, we surpass mere summaries. Using advanced models like ChatGPT (OpenAI), we analyze the text, asking crucial questions. Was the meeting productive? Did it foster toxicity? What were the key plans discussed? These insights are invaluable.

🔍 Now, let me unveil the project I've worked in last 24 hour:

1️⃣ I developed a powerful function that automatically breaks down meeting videos into convenient one-minute chunks.
2️⃣ Leveraging the advanced Whisper model, I extracted transcriptions for each one-minute segment and stored them in an organized CSV file.
3️⃣ Employing an efficient summarization pipeline, I generated comprehensive meeting summaries. Furthermore, I calculated sentiment and toxicity scores for each minute, providing an in-depth analysis.
4️⃣ To visualize the data effectively, I created detailed graphs and charts, highlighting moments of criticism, constructive feedback, and distinguishing between respectful discussions and toxic exchanges.

🔮 Limited access prevented ChatGPT or LLM integration. I urge companies, especially Microsoft, to adopt these ideas for growth, subscriptions, and positive work environments.


👍 Let's explore the benefits of this concept:

Cons :
Computation expensive for very large amount of recorded meetings.

Pros :
1. Precise visibility into employee performance and their contributions to the company's success.
2. Identify individuals who engage in negative conversations or undermine others within the company.
3. Provide comprehensive meeting summaries for absent employees, ensuring they stay informed.
4. Equip company management teams with invaluable insights to optimize the workplace environment.
